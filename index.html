	<h2>Workshops</h2>

	<p>It's not going to be like in a school. Our amazing workshop leaders will prepare for you 5 workshops stations. Workshop on each station
		will take up to one hour and then you move on to the next one. They are also asynchronous which means that you can spend on each station as much or as little time as you need. In 6 hours (+breakfast & lunch) you will build your own Arduino for 25 PLN, learn about printing and modeling in 3D, building Lego Mindstorms robots, micro-location and Low-Energy Bluetooth. Of course, all required equipements and hardware will be provided and are included in the ticket. Only thing you have to bring with you is a proper attitiude and your laptop!</p>

<div id="faq">
	<h2>Questions you may ask us:</h2>

	<div>
		<b>What do I have to bring with me?</b><br />

		1) A laptop. Best are those using Linux or Mac OS X<br />
		2) A ticket or ID
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Do I have to be a programmer to attend?</b><br />
		No but you at least need a working knowledge about programming, meaning you wrote a function or two in your life before.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Why workshops are called stations?</b><br />
		In their nature they are asynchronous, so you can join and leave when it suits you. This means you can choose in which order you want to visit stations or spend most time on those which interest you the most. You decide.
	</div>
	<div class="cls"></div>
	<div>
		<b>What is the formula behind stations?</b><br />
		Stations are assisted self-learning experience. You can sit whenever you want, and start going through the prepared tutorial. You can always talk to station leader and ask for his assistance.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>What if I want to join a station that is full?</b><br />
		Just come a little bit later, no worries!
		</div>
	<div>
		<b>I already know everything about Internet of Things, 3D printing etc. is this an event for me?</b><br />
		Nope, you'll probably be bored. But hey, it'd be awesome if you want to help out as station leader! Make sure to get in touch with us: <a href="mailto:meetup@makerland.org">meetup@makerland.org</a>
	</div>
	<div class="cls"></div>
	<div>
		<b>Is MakerMeetup: Workshops a competition?</b><br />
		No :) You come just for fun and learning.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Will there be food?</b><br />
		Yes. And it'll be healthy & tasty!
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Will there be more MakerMeetup: Workshops?</b><br />
		Workshops are tough to organize, so we can do this max twice a year. But we are planning monthly MakerMeetups in Warsaw, starting December 2013.
